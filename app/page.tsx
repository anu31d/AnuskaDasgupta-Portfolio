✨ Gratitude & Celebration! 2nd Prize @SARAM 2025 Expo✨

Sometimes, all it takes is one leap of faith to realize your true potential.

What started as a reluctant registration, turned into an unforgettable journey. We cleared the selection round, presented our project at SARAM 2025 conducted by SRM Institute of Science and Technology, Ramapuram, and secured 2nd place with a ₹25,000 prize!

The expo was beyond inspiring! Engaging with 20+ schools, students from grades 8-12, and fellow college peers made the experience even more enriching. Thought-provoking questions, invaluable suggestions, and meaningful conversations filled those two days.

This achievement is a testament to countless sleepless nights, endless debugging, and unwavering persistence. As a child, technology felt like a distant, unattainable dream, a world of endless possibilities. Today, I am living that dream. I am beyond grateful for this journey, the lessons learned, and the unwavering support of those around me. 

Grateful to our Chief Guest, Ponnusundar Murugiah (Director - Digital Engineering & Product Management, AT&T), for his inspiring presence. We are privileged to receive this award in the presence of esteemed dignitaries.
🟢 Dr. Shivakumar R – Chairman, SRM Group of Institutions

🚀 Proud to Present: Our Journey with Ruhi: The AI-Powered Personal & Virtual Mental Health Chatbot Assistant @SaRaM 2025🌟

We recently had the incredible opportunity to present "Ruhi", our AI-powered mental health chatbot, at our college's Project Day SARAM, a two-day Science Expo. Ruhi addresses the growing mental health crisis by offering 24/7 accessible, non-judgmental support, promoting mindfulness, emotional well-being, and stress management. Built with advanced NLP tools, it ensures privacy and empathy, with future goals to integrate voice assistants, multilingual support, and tailored therapy programs.

The expo was an unforgettable experience! The engagement was phenomenal with over 20 schools visiting us—students from grades 8 to 12—and fellow college students stopping by. The two days were filled with insightful questions, valuable suggestions, and meaningful conversations.

Our Dean's encouragement to integrate a voice assistant was a significant takeaway, and we are excited to take Ruhi to new heights. This journey has been a remarkable learning experience, pushing us to explore various technologies and refine our project.

I’m immensely grateful to my college, SRM Institute of Science and Technology, Ramapuram, for organizing such an impactful event, our guide, Dr. Adlene Packiadoss Ebenezer, for being a constant pillar of support, and my teammates Deshvant Raj Gupta and Anuska Pan. 

Here's to bridging the gap in mental health services and creating a healthier, stigma-free society! 💙

Chatbot Alchemy wasn’t just an event but a powerhouse of AI, innovation, and real-world chatbot applications. We sparked discussions, explored cutting-edge tech, and pushed boundaries because that’s what true innovators do. 

As the Vice President of Intellects, this was more than just organizing; it was about vision, impact, and making things happen. 

The challenges? Tackled.

"Master AI with PromptKraft" was a phenomenal experience. 

It was a special milestone for me, as it was my first event as the Vice President of Intellects Club SRM Ramapuram conducted at SRM Institute of Science and Technology, Ramapuram.

Leading the technical domain, the creative and content domain, and the event management domain while keeping admin work in check was both challenging and rewarding at the same time. With 89 participants, the energy was electric as we explored Zero-shot, Few-shot & Chain-of-Thought prompting, built AI-powered chatbots, and dived deep into LLMs & ethical AI. Seeing attendees actively engage and innovate made all the effort worth it!

A huge shoutout to my incredible team for their dedication. I want to mention SOUMYA KAR for being such a supportive President. I want to thank the respective domain leads Deshvant Raj Gupta, Neha Panbude, Sushree Sangita Ray, Ankur Gohain, Thanvarshini Ravikumar, Suvidha Ilindra and Yashmit Rai for putting their best foot forward always. I am grateful to everyone who joined. This is just the beginning of many more impactful events ahead! 🚀

I am pleased to share that I’ve completed the GenAI – LLMs & Hugging Face workshop, conducted by Cuvette Tech on 14th June, 2025.

🔍 Key Technical Learnings:

• Gained a clear understanding of Generative AI and how it differs from traditional AI, shifting from rule-based prediction to creative content generation.
 • Explored how Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT work by predicting the next token using transformer-based architectures.
 • Understood the inner workings of neural networks and transformers, including self-attention, positional encoding, and multi-head mechanisms.
 • Learned to use the Hugging Face transformers library to load, fine-tune, and deploy state-of-the-art models like GPT-2 and BERT.
 • Studied training workflows of GenAI, including pre-training, fine-tuning, and transfer learning for domain-specific tasks.
 • Investigated sampling methods (greedy, top-k, nucleus) and how temperature influences randomness and creativity in outputs.
 • Reflected on key limitations of GenAI, such as hallucination, bias, and lack of explainability.

Grateful to Cuvette and Divyansh Dubey for curating such a well-structured, hands-on experience.

"SMARTATHON 2025"

In March , I had the incredible opportunity to participate in SMARTATHON 2025 conducted by St. Joseph's College of Engineering, where technology met purpose and passion transformed into impact.

As the lead developer of Ruhi, an AI-powered mental health chatbot, this hackathon was a milestone moment.

Ruhi isn’t just code; it’s compassion wrapped in algorithms, built to listen, support, and empower.

🔹 Why Ruhi?
 In a world battling silent struggles, Ruhi emerges as a non-judgemental companion, always there, always understanding. With every update, we aim to make emotional support more human, more real, and more accessible.

🔹 Latest Milestone:
 Proud to share that we’re on the brink of a major leap, Ruhi now speaks.
 We’ve almost integrated a full-fledged voice assistant, making conversations more natural and accessible for users who need verbal interaction more than text. This journey from typed support to spoken empathy has been technically thrilling and emotionally rewarding.

🔹 Tech Stack and Innovation:
 • AI-powered NLP engine detecting user sentiment in real time
 • Voice interaction module (Beta), conversational AI powered by speech-to-text and text-to-speech
 • Privacy-first architecture, built with care, encrypted with intent
 • Mindfulness toolkit, from grounding exercises to crisis guidance

🔹 Highlight of the Event:
 It was an honour to receive the business card of one of the esteemed jury members, who resonated deeply with our mission. That simple gesture felt like a spark of validation for a project built straight from the heart and fueled by lines of Python.

None of this would have been possible without the constant collaboration, energy, and creativity of my amazing teammates, Deshvant Raj Gupta, Neha Panbude and SOUMYA KAR. Thank you for being such incredible co-creators in this journey.

Participating in SMARTATHON wasn’t just about solving problems; it was about constant innovation and improvement. Let’s keep creating technology that heals.
